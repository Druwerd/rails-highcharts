== rails-highcharts

This is a proof of concept to display realtime server stats in a graphical web interface.
The idea is to go beyond static trend graphs to live dynamic graphs.

This project uses: 
highcharts javascript library (http://www.highcharts.com/)
rrdtool (http://www.mrtg.org/rrdtool/)
rrd-ffi (https://rubygems.org/gems/rrd-ffi)
